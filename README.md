# Travlr Getaways - Travel Booking Web App
MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js

## Project Overview
Travlr Getaways is a full-stack travel booking web application that enables customers to search, book trips, and manage their itineraries. The platform features both customer-facing and admin-facing functionalities, offering a seamless experience for users to explore and manage their travel plans.

This project was developed as part of the CS-465 Full Stack Development course at Southern New Hampshire University, showcasing my skills in full-stack development using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js).

## Features
- Customer Portal: Users can search for travel destinations, browse available trips, and book their getaways directly through the platform.
- Admin Portal: Administrators can manage itineraries, update trip details, and oversee customer bookings.
- Secure Login & Authentication: Implemented JWT-based authentication to ensure secure access to both customer and admin portals.
- Responsive UI: Built with Angular to provide a dynamic, fast, and mobile-friendly experience for users on all devices.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: Angular (for building dynamic and responsive SPAs)
- Backend: Node.js and Express (for building RESTful APIs)
- Database: MongoDB (NoSQL database for flexible and scalable data storage)
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and role-based access control

## Architecture
- The application utilizes a hybrid architecture combining server-side rendering for the admin portal with an Angular-based single-page application (SPA) for the customer-facing features.
- The backend communicates with a MongoDB database, allowing for dynamic data handling and scalability. The APIs, designed with Express, provide secure, efficient data flow between the client and server.

## Key Features Implemented
- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system with JWT tokens for both customers and administrators.
- RESTful APIs: Developed to handle data transactions like creating, updating, and deleting itineraries, as well as booking and managing trips.
- Dynamic Itinerary Management: Customers can search, book, and track trips while admins can manage trip details, booking records, and customer data.
- Responsive Design: Designed with mobile-first principles, ensuring an optimized experience across all devices.

## Testing
- Comprehensive testing of all API endpoints, including CRUD operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), ensuring functionality and data integrity.
- Security measures were implemented, such as JWT authentication, and role-based access control for protected routes.

# Reflection
This project significantly enhanced my full-stack development skills, particularly with Angular, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js. Through the course of building this application, I gained hands-on experience in designing scalable web apps, optimizing user interactions, and ensuring secure, efficient communication between the front-end and back-end. These skills are invaluable in todayâ€™s job market, where full-stack developers are in high demand.
