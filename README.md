CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
## Architecture
I used various front-end development methodologies in my full-stack project, such as Express-rendered HTML, JavaScript, and an Angular-based single-page application (SPA). Express with Handlebars templating enabled server-side rendering, which means pages were dynamically produced on the backend before being transmitted to the client. In comparison, the Angular-based SPA offered a more engaging experience by rendering views directly in the browser and dynamically updating content without needing full-page reloads. The SPA method resulted in a more seamless user experience, lower server load, and enhanced performance, but with a longer initial load time. 
The backend used a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its ability to handle unstructured data, scalability, and interface simplicity with JavaScript-based technologies such as Node.js and Express. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents, allowing for more dynamic schema modifications, which are especially useful for ever-changing applications. 
## Functionality
JSON differs from JavaScript because it is a lightweight data format communicating data between a client and a server. At the same time, JavaScript is a computer language used in web applications to provide logic and interactivity. JSON connects the front and back end by allowing structured data to be transmitted seamlessly, making it a critical component of API communication.
I refactored code to increase functionality and performance throughout the stack development process. For example, I streamlined API calls to avoid duplicate data gathering and used Angular's reusable UI components to simplify the user experience. Reusable components, such as modular form inputs and navigation elements, improve the application's maintainability and consistency by minimizing code duplication and simplifying modifications. 
## Testing
Testing API endpoints was critical to guarantee the consistency of request and retrieval procedures. GET queries were tested to ensure data extraction from the MongoDB database, while POST, PUT, and DELETE requests were verified to ensure successful data creation, updates, and deletions. Security complicates testing since authentication layers require effective token handling and role-based access controls to validate protected endpoints. Understanding API methods, secure authentication techniques, and endpoint validation were critical to maintaining a functional and secure full-stack application. 
## Reflection
This course has helped my professional development by providing critical full-stack development abilities. I've learned to use front-end frameworks like Angular, backend technologies like Express and MongoDB, and integrate APIs. The experience of developing, testing, and optimizing a full-stack application has improved my problem-solving skills and expanded my understanding of scalable web development. These abilities make me a stronger contender in the job market because they correspond to industry demands for developers who can adequately manage client- and server-side development.
